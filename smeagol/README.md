# Smeagol: automatically uses XP or CP rings.

https://www.ffxiah.com/forum/topic/53244/smeagol-automatically-use-xpcp-rings/

Smeagol will use CP rings at level 99, or XP rings at any level below 99.
Rings need to be in Inventory, or Wardrobe 1-4. If you want to keep a ring from being used, put it in any other bag.

### Available commands:
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
|//smeagol on\|start\|off\|stop | Starts or stops Smeagol.|  
|//smeagol xp\|all\|normal | Changes how Smeagol chooses the ring to use at level 99:|
||`xp` will force use of XP rings _only_, even at level 99.|
||`both` will prioritize CP rings, but will also use XP rings if they're available.|
||`normal` will only use XP rings levels below 99, and only CP rings at level 99.|
||Default is Normal.|
||Note: CP rings will only ever be used at level 99.|
|//smeagol \<number\>| How often Smeagol should check if an exp buff is active, in seconds. Default is 4.|  
|//smeagol check| Come out of sleep and check for usable rings.|  
|//smeagol reset| Restores default settings.|  
|//smeagol town| Toggles use of rings while in town. Default is no.|
|//smeagol r|reload|u|unload| - Reloads/unloads Smeagol.|  

Settings are not saved. You can edit the preference table in the lua directly.

Thanks to Kale for his gearswap suite, Smeagol started with code from that.  
thanks to from20020516, the code that check for ring cooldown is from him.
